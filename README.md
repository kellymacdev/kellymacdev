# Hi, I’m Kelly  


### I’m a **theoretical cosmologist turned wannabe software developer** with a background in mathematical modeling, dynamical systems and data analysis. After completing my PhD in **modified gravity and braneworld cosmology**, I’ve been rediscovering the creativity and fun of bringing ideas to life; teaching myself **software development** by designing and building creative, playful projects — the same kind of curiosity-driven work that fueled my research.

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- Developing **data-driven web apps** with **React** and **Django**
-  Building **Blunderstruck**, a chess stats visualiser to make fun of my boyfriend's poor performance
-  Maintaining and generalising **Yearbook**, a web app serving as a digital 10-years-on high school reunion yearbook
- Deepening my understanding of the **mathematical foundations and algorithms behind AI** through Harvard’s CS50AI course

### 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Mathematica, LaTeX  
**Frameworks:** Django, React, React Native  
**Tools:** Git, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Overleaf  
**Interests:** Full-stack development, data visualization, AI/ML applications

### 🎓 Background
During my PhD, I developed a strong foundation in:
- Complex systems modeling  
- Symbolic and numerical computation  
- Communicating technical ideas clearly through code and writing  

### That same problem-solving mindset now drives how I approach software design and development.
