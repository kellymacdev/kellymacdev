## Hi, I’m Kelly  

#### I’m a **theoretical cosmologist turned wannabe software developer** with a background in mathematical modeling, dynamical systems and data analysis. After completing my PhD in modified gravity and braneworld cosmology, I’ve been rediscovering the creativity and fun of bringing ideas to life; teaching myself software development by designing and building creative, playful projects — the same kind of curiosity-driven work that fueled my research.

### What I’m working on
- Developing data-driven web apps with React and Django
-  Building *Blunderstruck*, a chess stats visualiser to make fun of my boyfriend's poor performance
-  Maintaining and generalising *Yearbook*, a web app serving as a digital 10-years-on high school reunion yearbook
- Deepening my understanding of the mathematical foundations and algorithms behind AI through Harvard’s CS50AI course

### Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Mathematica, LaTeX  
**Frameworks:** Django, React, React Native  
**Tools:** Git, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Overleaf  
**Interests:** Full-stack development, data visualization, AI/ML applications

### Background
During my PhD, I developed a strong foundation in:
- Complex systems modeling  
- Symbolic and numerical computation  
- Communicating technical ideas clearly through code and writing  

#### That same problem-solving mindset now drives how I approach software design and development.
